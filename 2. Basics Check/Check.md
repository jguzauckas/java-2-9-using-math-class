# Basics Check

Make two integer variables with the values `15` and `-102` and two double variables with the values `12.56` and `-45.87`.

Using the variables, do the following:
- Print the result of raising `15` to the `12.56` power.
- Print the result of the absolute value of `15` minus `12.56`.
- Print the result of the square root of `-102` times `-45.87`.

Not necessarily using the variables above, create a 20-sided dice that prints a sentence like `"You rolled a #"`. The possible results should be whole numbers from 1 to 20.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
