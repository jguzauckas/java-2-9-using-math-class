# AP Computer Science A - Unit 2 Section 9

# Using the `Math` Class

This final section of the objects unit is meant to give us more mathematical tools to further our understanding of object-oriented programming.

Due to the nature of Java, certain elements of a Java program are going to be taken for granted and ultimately ignored as we work with the basics, but are required for the program to run successfully. I encourage you to read them and start to internalize them as they'll become a key aspect of the work we do as the year goes on.

This section covers the following material:

- Absolute Value
- Exponents
- Square Roots
- Random Numbers

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
