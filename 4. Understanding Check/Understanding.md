# Understanding Check

3D solids have two mathematical properties we often look at: surface area and volume.

Create four variables with the appropriate types to hold the following information:
- `r1` is `5.6`
- `r2` is `3.1`
- `h1` is `15.2`
- `h2` is `6.7`

These variables represent the `radius` and `height` of two different cylinders, `1` and `2`.

Here are instructions on calculating the surface area of the cylinders:
1. We need 2 times the area of the circle with the cylinder's radius.
2. We need the area of the rectangle that wraps around, given by the circumference of the circle times the height.
3. We then add these two pieces together to get our total surface area.

Then print out a sentence for each cylinder stating `"A cylinder with a radius of # and a height of # would have a surface area of #."`

Here is how we calculate the volume of a cylinder:
1. Take the area of the circle with the cylinder's radius and multiply it by the cylinder's height.

Then print out a sentence for each cylinder stating `"A cylinder with a radius of # and a height of # would have a volume of #."`
